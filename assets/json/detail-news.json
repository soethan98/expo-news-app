The statement claimed that the ministry took steps \"to protect civil rights in higher education\" and that Harvard, one of the universities prominent in pro-Palestine demonstrations, \"failed to address antisemitic attitudes and racial discrimination.\" The statement noted that a new federal fund cut of approximately $60 million would be imposed on the university, adding that the Trump administration \"will not tolerate discrimination on campuses and federal funds should support institutions that protect all students.\"\nDispute Between Trump and Harvard\nThe federal government had threatened to freeze federal funds for many universities, including Harvard, citing campus protests for Palestine support and diversity, equity, and inclusion programs as reasons. During this process, an \"Antisemitism Fight Task Force\" was established in partnership with the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the General Services Administration (GSA).\nThe Trump administration decided to freeze $2.2 billion in funds and $60 million in contract fees provided to Harvard, and the university filed a lawsuit to prevent this decision, arguing that the federal government's freezing of funds was unlawful.",
